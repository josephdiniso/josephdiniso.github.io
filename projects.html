            <br>Using the Python DLIB library, I created a facial landmark detector using a pretrained 
            model. The detector places six points around the eye in designated positions. Using these landmark points
            I then calculated the aspect ratio of the eye by taking the distance from the top of the eye to the bottom,
            as well as the distance from the left to the right. Then dividing the vertical distance by the horizontal I was
            able to get an aspect ratio. When the aspect ratio went below a certain threshold, for over five milliseconds,
            then a blink would be registered.<br><br>Before running the script, the user must input an argument with the letters
            given to them in an Anagrams game. The program then calculates the longest possible anagrams (with a six 
            letter maximum) and displays them to the user with the longest (and most point lucrative) words appearing
            first. When the user blinks the program will then show the next word, allowing the user to input words
            as quickly as possible.<br><br>To see the source code and how to use the program, click

        <p class="frontp"><br>Using the PyGame Python library I wrote the game 'Snake'. In future iterations I hope to add a reinforcement learning model
          such as Q-Learning <br>to have the game play itself and develop inhuman strategies. The current source code is available on my github at <a href="https://github.com/josephdiniso/PySnake" target="_blank">
            my github</a>. Use the README for<br> instructions on how to play it. NOTE: The reinforcement learning model is currently in development so the code is messy.
